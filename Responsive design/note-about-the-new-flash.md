# Note about ’the new Flash’

> I've been involved in UI/UX since the stone ages (early 90's) and the redesign that occurred here is an example of much of the redesign I've seen over the last couple of years where organizations remove the key features that attract users and "hide" those features at a deeper level (or remove them completely).
>
> As someone who watched and dismissed the rise of Flash websites (which I called Vanity sites) and landing pages back in the day that forced a user to watch a video or animation or some other visual trickery that had nothing to do with the core service/product, I am astounded that so many sites now are doing the same things but with different tools.

> Whatever your core differentiator is, that's what should be featured. Check your ego at the door and prominently display the features that people love.
