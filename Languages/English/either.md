# Either

Either… or is used to offer a choice between two possibilities:

> Either Mike or Lisa will be there.
> 
> Either you leave me alone or I will call the police.
> 
> We should bring either coffee or tea.
> 
> You can either help us or go to your room.

Either can also be followed by (one) of + group of two:

> Either of us could do it.
> 
> Either one of us could do it.
> 
> Either of you should know.
> 
> Either one of you should know.
>
> I don’t think either Mike or Lisa will be there.
> 
> He doesn’t speak either English or French.

Not… either is used after a negative statement.

> I don’t speak French.
> 
> You don’t either.
> 
> He isn’t ready to go.
> 
> We aren’t either.
