# Jekyll drafts

Add a `_/drafts/` directory in the root. Drafts donâ€™t carry the date in their filenames.

To preview your site with drafts, run the `serve` command followed by a `--drafts` switch. Each will be assigned the value modification time of the draft file for its date, and thus you will see currently edited drafts as the latest posts.
