# Open files from command line

```bash
open -a TextEdit filename
```

The `-a` flag specifies any application you want, so it's  applicable to any number of situations, including ones where TextEdit  isn't the default editor.

## Other relevant options

- `-t ` opens in the default editor (i.e. if you use BBEdit, TextMate, etc.).
- `-e` will open the file specifically in TextEdit.
