# Finder tips

- **⌥ + double-click** on any window corner will make the window take up the whole visible space of the screen, without being ‘maximized’.
- Similarly, **double-clicking any edge** will make the window expand all the way to the border of the screen in the direction of the edge you clicked.
- ⌥-double-click an edge makes it grow both in that direction and the opposite.
