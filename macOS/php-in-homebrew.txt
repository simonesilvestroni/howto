# PHP in Homebrew

To enable PHP in Apache add the following to `httpd.conf` and restart Apache:
    
```
LoadModule php_module /usr/local/opt/php/lib/httpd/modules/libphp.so

<FilesMatch \.php$>
  SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>
```

Finally, check:

```
DirectoryIndex includes index.php
DirectoryIndex index.php index.html
```

The `php.ini` and `php-fpm.ini` files can be found under:

`/usr/local/etc/php/<PHPversion>/`

To start php now and restart at login:

```
brew services start php
```
