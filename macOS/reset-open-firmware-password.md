# MacOS reset open firmware password

1. Change the amount of RAM in the machine (either add memory or remove existing memory in the expansion slot). 
2. The first time booting after changing the RAM, reset the PRAM three times in a row. It needs to chime three times after the power-on chime.

**Note**: this doesnâ€™t work for certain models. It worked for my 2001 iBook.
