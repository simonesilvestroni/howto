# Finder tips

## Default column view in Finder

In column view in the Finder, you can resize columns by positioning the mouse pointer over over the thin line that separates column panes, and dragging it to the left to make it narrower or to the right to make it wider.

To make the Finder remember the new width, hold down the option key (`⌥`) while dragging the pane separator to the desired width.

The best documentation found on this from Apple alludes to the fact that holding down option resizes "all columns at once" but does not explicitly say that this makes the change persistent.

## See all files in a folder

In list view, select all by typing **⌘ A** and then **⌘ →**

## Finder windows

- **⌥ + double-click** on any window corner to make the window take up the whole visible space of the screen, without being ‘maximized’.
- **double-click any edge** to make the window expand all the way to the border of the screen in the direction of the edge you clicked.
- **⌥ + double-click** an edge to grow both in that direction and the opposite.
