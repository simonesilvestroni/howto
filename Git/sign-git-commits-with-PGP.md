# Sign git commits with PGP

List your private GPG key, run this command, replacing `<$EMAIL>` with the email address you used when you generated the key:

```bash
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG <$EMAIL>
```

Where `<$EMAIL>` needs to be replaced with the email address used in the GPG key. In the output, identify the `sec` line, and copy the GPG key ID. It begins after the `/` character. In this example, the key ID is `30F2B65B9246B6CA`:

```bash
sec   rsa4096/30F2B65B9246B6CA 2022-05-01 [SC] [expires: 2032-05-01]
      D5E4F29F3275DC0CDA8FFC8730F2B65B9246B6CA
uid                 [ultimate] Simone Silvestroni <$EMAIL>
ssb   rsa4096/B32A2F1C7F74D845 2022-05-01 [E] [expires: 2032-05-01]
```

To show the associated public key, run this command, replacing `<$ID>` with the GPG key ID from the previous step:

```bash
gpg --armor --export <$ID>
```

Copy the public key, including the `BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK` and `END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK` lines. You need this key in the next step.

## Procedure for GitLab

### Add a GPG key to your account

To add a GPG key to your user settings:

1. Sign in to GitLab.
2. In the top-right corner, select your avatar.
3. Select **Edit profile**.
4. On the left sidebar, select **GPG Keys**.
5. In **Key**, paste your *public* key.
6. To add the key to your account, select **Add key**. GitLab shows the keyâ€™s fingerprint, email address, and creation date.

To verify the key, the same email address associated to your GPG key needs to be present in your GitLab account.

### Associate your GPG key with Git

After you create your GPG key and [add it to your account](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/gpg_signed_commits/index.html#add-a-gpg-key-to-your-account), you must configure Git to use this key:

Run this command to list the private GPG key you just created, replacing `<$EMAIL>` with the email address for your key:

```bash
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG <$EMAIL>
```

Copy the GPG private key ID that starts with `sec`. In this example, the private key ID is `30F2B65B9246B6CA`:

```bash
sec   rsa4096/30F2B65B9246B6CA 2022-05-01 [SC] [expires: 2032-05-01]
      D5E4F29F3275DC0CDA8FFC8730F2B65B9246B6CA
uid                 [ultimate] Simone Silvestroni <$EMAIL>
ssb   rsa4096/B32A2F1C7F74D845 2022-05-01 [E] [expires: 2032-05-01]
```

Run this command to configure Git to sign your commits with your key, replacing `<$KEYID>` with your GPG key ID:

```bash
git config --global user.signingkey <$KEYID>
```

Optional. If Git uses `gpg` and you get errors like `secret key not available` or `gpg: signing failed: secret key not available`, run this command to use `gpg2` instead:

```bash
git config --global gpg.program gpg2
```

### Sign your Git commits

After you [add your public key to your account](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/gpg_signed_commits/index.html#add-a-gpg-key-to-your-account), you can sign individual commits manually, or configure Git to default to signed commits.

#### Sign individual Git commits manually

Add `-S` flag to any commit you want to sign:

```bash
git commit -S -m "My commit message"
```

Enter the passphrase of your GPG key when asked.

Push to GitLab and check that your commits [are verified](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/gpg_signed_commits/index.html#verify-commits).

Sign all Git commits by default by running this command:

```bash
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```
