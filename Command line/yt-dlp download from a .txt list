First, assuming I have a file on the Desktop named `my-text-list.txt`, check the quality and type of videos:

```bash
yt-dlp -F -a ~/Desktop/my-text-list.txt
```

Then, if the download type is an audio file and its ID is `140` (for example), type:

```bash
yt-dlp -f 140 -a ~/Desktop/my-text-list.txt
```
