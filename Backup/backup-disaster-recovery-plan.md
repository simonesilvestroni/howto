# Backup disaster recovery plan

1. What would you do if you lost your phone?
2. If you were locked out of your Apple or Google account?
3. If you forgot your password manager master password?
4. If your home was destroyed in a fire?

Having a secure plan for quickly recovering from these scenarios is important.
